# fall2025-Weiyan-Huang!

the current stage is following the option A(multi-page). this is because it seem to be the version that fit the need of previous wireframe. although the start page is still made of place holder image because I didn't have the detail plan for each level of the game.

home page, start page(for selecting levels), each level of the game(still thinking), about page(list all the info of creator and contact)

user could access each page by clicking buttons assign to them.

26/10/2025 the start.html and about.html was added to the project.
